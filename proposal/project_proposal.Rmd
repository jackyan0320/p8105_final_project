### Title: Analyzing trends in organ donor registration in New York State

### Data sources: 

- [New York State Organ and Tissue Donor Counts](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Donate-Life-Organ-and-Tissue-Donor-Registry-Enroll/sqk8-8a2h/data?fbclid=IwAR0DjHPMd3up76Cq1bMH0z12f_vr4rLz5YwtMPcT2kc_a5nP-nVJlDEinNE)
- United States Census information supplied by Area health resources file and SAIPE

### The motivation for this project

Organ donor shortage is a public health crisis in New York state. In 2015 New York had the lowest donor registration rate in the US and in general, New York is known for [its low registration rate](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/nyregion/organ-donation-is-desperate-in-new-york.html). Although people waiting for organs from deceased donors can register on other states' registries, there are often difficulties in doing this, especially for people of lower socio-economic status. Between June 2016 and June 2017 7.2 percent of waitlisted potential organ recipients died while waiting for an [organ at CUMC](https://www.srtr.org/transplant-centers/ny-presbyterian-hospitalcolumbia-univ-medical-center-nycp/?organ=kidney&recipientType=adult&donorType=). It is important that New York encourage its eligible pool of donors to register, so that life saving organs do not go to waste.  

[The govenor of New York has taken measures](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-announces-over-5-million-new-yorkers-enrolled-states-donate-life-registry-organ)  such as adding the option to register on health insurance applications as well as better wording the donation registration option on drivers license applications. 

More targeted efforts could be beneficial for increasing organ donor registration rates in New York. Our group will compare county wide donor registration rates in New York to see if there are counties that are especially lacking in donor registration. We will look at different county wide factors such as median income level and education levels and will explore possible correlations with organ donor registration. 

To identify regions that need more attention, it is important that we compare donor registration trends across counties. Are some counties with very low registration rates making progress while others are not? How did different counties respond to legislation put in place by Andrew Cuomo in 2016 and 2017? 


### Intended final product

*  A final report
*  A webpage
*  A screencast

### Analyses

In this project, we will:

* Compare county wide donor registration rates in New York to see if there are counties that are lacking in donor registration. We will map the registration rate on to a New York state map using `ggmap`.
* Explore possible correlations between county wide factors (such as median income level) and organ donor registration rate. 
* Compare donor registration rate trends across counties using an animated plot.
