### Title: Analyzing trends in organ donor registration in New York State

### The motivation for this project

Organ donor shortage is a public health crisis in New York state. New Yorkers can choose to join the deceased donor registry when they apply for a drivers license, but not nearly enough chose to register on the donor list to meet the high demand. 

Our project's aim is to compare how the proportion of people registered to donate organs (with number of eligible donors in the denominator) differs between counties in New York. We will look at county level factors that may be correlated with county level donor registration proportions. These factors include income, education shares, and other various factors.
