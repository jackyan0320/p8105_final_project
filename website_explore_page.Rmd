## Enroll Number vs County Pop

Number of enrollment increases as NY's counties population increse.

```

The NY's counties with the lowest enrollment tend to be in the New York City area. The larger counties have lower registration rates, which is problematic, since larger counties have the potential to provide the most organs.

## Registration Over Time 
In NY state the registry enrollments showed a generally increasing trend across the years. However, note that there is a sudden change in registry enrollments on 2009-06-01 and 2017-10-1. Curiously, the enrollment even declined for some counties on 2017-10-1, which indicates an aspect of limitation of the dataset.

```{r}
county_enrollment_plot = 
  organ %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = registry_enrollments, color = county)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(x = "Date", 
         y = "Persons enrolled", 
         title = "Registry enrollments across time") + 
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE)

ggplotly(county_enrollment_plot)
```

This plot shows the trend of registration rate from 2008 to 2018 for counties in New York State. Note that the registration rates for Counties Cattauragus and St Lawrence were not updated throughout the years.
     
```{r message = F, warning= F}
county_enrollment_rate_plot = 
  organ %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = eligible_population_enrolled, color = county)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(x = "Date", 
         y = "% Persons enrolled", 
         title = "Registration rate across time") + 
  viridis::scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE)

ggplotly(county_enrollment_rate_plot)
```

There was a huge leap in pupulation_18_estimate at 2017-10-01 among almost all the counties
