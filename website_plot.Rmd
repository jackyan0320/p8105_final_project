#Plotting Eligible Percent Enrolled Versus Population

```{r}
organ %>% 
  filter(date == as.Date("2018-09-01")) %>% 
  filter(county!= "TOTAL NYS") %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~population_18_estimate, y = ~eligible_population_enrolled, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
          alpha = 0.5, 
          text = ~county)

#If you have a county that has a higher population of people, a higher percent enrolled is more helpful in terms of number of organs than if a county has a lower population of people, so New York should be taking advantage of larger counties, but this plot shows that larger counties tend to have lower percentages of eligible people enrolled. 

#smaller counties have higher percentages enrolled
